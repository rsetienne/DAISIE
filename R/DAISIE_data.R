#' * Non_endemic_MaxAge: for non-endemic island species when colonisation time is unknown \cr

#' * "Endemic_MaxAge": applies to endemic species or endemic clades for cases where the

#' the user wants to specify an upper bound for colonisation.
#' This could for example apply to endemic species that have recently gone extinct because
#' of anthropogenic causes, and which are not included

#' could also apply to insular radiations with long stem branches, for which the
#' time of the first cladogenetic event is known, but the precise time of colonisation
#' is not.\cr
#' * Endemic&Non_Endemic: when endemic clade and mainland ancestor has

#'
#' \code{$Missing_species} - Number of island species that
#' were not sampled for particular clade (only applicable for endemic clades)\cr
#' \code{$Branching_times} - Stem age of the population/species in the case of "Non_endemic",

#' @description A table containing the colonization and branching times of the Eleutherodacytlus
#'frogs of the island of Hispaniola (Greater Antilles). Each row on the table represents and independent
#' colonisation event. The table has four columns. \cr \cr
#' \code{$Clade_name} -
#' name of independent colonization event \cr
#' \code{$Status} - One of the
#' following categories: \cr
#' * Non_endemic: for non-endemic island species when an approximate time of colonisation is known \cr
#' * Non_endemic_MaxAge: for non-endemic island species when colonisation time is unknown \cr
#' * Endemic: for endemic species when an approximate colonisation time is known \cr
#' * "Endemic_MaxAge": applies to endemic species or endemic clades for cases where the
#' colonisation time is unknown, or when
#' the user wants to specify an upper bound for colonisation.
#' This could for example apply to endemic species that have recently gone extinct because
#' of anthropogenic causes, and which are not included
#' in the phylogeny ("NA" should be given in the branching times column). It
#' could also apply to insular radiations with long stem branches, for which the
#' time of the first cladogenetic event is known, but the precise time of colonisation
#' is not.\cr
#' * Endemic&Non_Endemic: when endemic clade and mainland ancestor has
#' re-colonized \cr

#' @name stac_table
#' @title Explanatory table on meaning and use of \code{stac} settings
#' @docType data
#' @format A table with 9 rows and 5 columns.
#' @description
#' A table containing the information regarding the meaning
#' of the \code{stac} codes utilised by DAISIE's ML functions. It is used to
#' render the "DAISIE \code{stac} values" vignette. \cr \cr
#' \code{stac} stands for "status of the clade" formed by the immigrant. It is
#' an important part of DAISIE objects that informs the likelihood functions
#' about the endemicity status and type of data available for each insular
#' clade. Each colonisation event that has extant species on the island needs to
#' have a \code{stac} value specified. This also has implications in what is
#' included in the DAISIE object \code{"branching_times"} vector, which also
#' described in this table.
#' The table is composed of the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{$stac: A numeric with each stac code from 1 until 9.}
#'   \item{$Input for DAISIE_dataprep table "Clade_Name": A character
#'   with the possibilities for input in \link{DAISIE_dataprep}()
#'   of each clade, which are then translated to a numeric \code{stac} code as
#'   in \code{$stac}.}
#'   \item{$Type of species or clade": A character
#'   with the plain English explanation of the different possible kinds of
#'   island lineages that can be considered by DAISIE.}
#'   \item{$Input for DAISIE_dataprep table "Branching_times": A
#'   character with the plain English explanation of what the branching times
#'   vector in the DAISIE object should contain.}
#'   \item{$Colonisation times: A character with the plain English
#'   explanation of what the colonisation time in the branching times vector
#'   of the DAISIE object (first element of the vector) means.}

#' @description A list of lists containing the colonization and branching times
#' of simulated data sets using the MLE parameters of IW model for the
#' frogs_datalist. Each list is an R list object with the following elements.\cr \cr
#' The first element of the list has two components: \cr \cr
#' \code{$island_age} - the island age \cr
#' \code{$not_present} - the number of mainland lineages that are not present
#' on the island \cr \cr
#' The following elements of the list each contains
#' information on a single colonist lineage on the island and has 5
#' components:\cr \cr
#' \code{$colonist_name} - the name of the species or clade
#' that colonized the island \cr
#' \code{$branching_times} - island age followed by stem age of the population/species
#' in the case of Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge species and Endemic species with no close
#' relatives on the island. For endemic clades with more than one species on the island
#' (cladogenetic clades/ radiations) these should be island age followed by the
#' branching times of the island clade including the stem age of the clade.\cr
#' \code{$stac} - the status of the colonist \cr \cr
#' * Non_endemic_MaxAge: 1 \cr
#' * Endemic: 2 \cr
