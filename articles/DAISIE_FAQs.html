<p><strong>DAISIE FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1 – What is DAISIE?</strong></p>
<p>DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Islands through Speciation, Immigration
and Extinction) is a modelling framework implemented in an <a href="https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.DAISIE" class="external-link">R package</a> that
allows estimating rates of speciation (cladogenesis and anagenesis),
colonisation, extinction and a carrying-capacity for a focal assemblage
of island species based on phylogenetic information, for various
macroevolutionary models of island assembly. It also allows simulating
islands under rates for those processes. The method was first introduced
in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12461" class="external-link">Valente, Phillimore &amp;
Etienne 2015</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q2 – What is DAISIEprep?</strong></p>
<p>DAISIEprep (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.19.529129" class="external-link">Lambert et al
2023</a>), is an R package that we have developed to help users prepare
the data for running DAISIE analyses. It is not compulsory to use
DAISIEprep, but it greatly helps! <a href="https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.DAISIE" class="external-link">DAISIE</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.DAISIEprep" class="external-link">DAISIEprep</a>
are two separate R packages that can be independently installed from
CRAN. DAISIEprep contains certain functions for extracting, plotting,
and visualising data that can be useful for those working on island
biogeography but who do not necessarily want to use DAISIE.</p>
<p><strong>Q3 – What input data do I need to have to run a DAISIE
model?</strong></p>
<p>DAISIE uses an unconventional data format. Since a DAISIE analysis is
centered on a focal island assemblage, it requires the times of
colonisation and speciation events for all the lineages that make up the
focal community. This information can come from various sources: a
single phylogeny for your group of interest if available, several
different phylogenies representing individual lineages that make up the
focal community, values obtained from the literature, or a mix of
sources. DAISIE can also handle some missing data (see below and Q14).
There is no way around it: DAISIE is very data demanding! But that is
why you can do very cool things with it 😊. DAISIE requires as input the
following data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><u>Checklist of ALL native island species of your focal group</u>
(e.g., a list of all amphibians on an island; all plants on an island;
all Orchidaceae species on an island; all passerine birds on an
island).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Island endemicity status</u> for each of those species:
whether they are endemic to the island (occur only on the island) or
whether they are non-endemic (occur on the island and also
elsewhere)</p></li>
<li><p><u>Colonisation times</u> for all the lineages of your focal
group that have colonised the island (these can be extracted from
phylogenies or from other estimates obtained from the
literature)</p></li>
<li><p><u>Speciation times</u> (branching events) for all the lineages
that have speciated/radiated on the island (these can be extracted from
phylogenies or from other estimates obtained from the
literature)</p></li>
<li><p><u>Missing island lineages</u>: island lineages of your focal
group for which phylogenetic data is not available. An island lineage is
a group of island species (one or more species) that descend from the
same mainland species. So, for example, an island radiation is a
lineage, but a single non-endemic species that has no close relatives on
the island is also its own island lineage. For example, if no
phylogenetic data is available for lineage x of your focal group, you
need to tell DAISIE that lineage x is present on the island and also how
many species belong to lineage x.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Missing island species</u>: for island lineages for which
phylogenetic data is available for some of the species but not others,
you need to tell DAISIE the number of missing island species on the
lineage.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Island age</u>: An estimate of the geological age of the
island (when did the island become available for colonisation, when did
the island first emerge).</p></li>
<li><p><u>Mainland pool size</u>: An estimate of the size of the
mainland pool – how many species of the focal group occur on the
mainland (e.g., a list of all amphibians on the mainland; all plants on
an mainland; all Orchidaceae species on the mainland; all passerine
birds on the mainland) and could have colonised the island.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4 – What kind of questions can be addressed with
DAISIE?</strong></p>
<p>We answer this FAQ by providing examples of questions that have
already been addressed in different publications that have used
DAISIE.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are the rates of colonisation, speciation (cladogenesis and
anagenesis) and extinction for an island or archipelago? Examples:
Galápagos birds (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12461" class="external-link">Valente et
al 2015</a>), Caribbean frogs (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.2171" class="external-link">Jiménez-Ortega et al
2023</a>), fishes of Lake Biwa Japan (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13914" class="external-link">Hauffe et al
2020</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>How does island area, dynamic connectivity, geological history
affect phylogenetic and diversity patterns on islands? Examples:
Hawaiian islands (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14519" class="external-link">Neves et
al 2022</a>), oceanic islands (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.3227" class="external-link">Valente et al
2014</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>How old are island lineages under different (simulated)
scenarios? Examples: oceanic islands (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.3227" class="external-link">Valente et al 2014</a>),
continental, oceanic and land-bridge islands (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14519" class="external-link">Neves et al 2022</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>How does trait dependent diversification affect phylogenetic and
diversity patterns on islands? Example: Simulated data (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/evolut/qpad006" class="external-link">Xie et al
2023</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Is a radiation on an island exceptional? Examples: Darwin’s
finches (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12461" class="external-link">Valente et al
2015</a>), Caribbean frogs (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.2171" class="external-link">Jiménez-Ortega et al
2023</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Do rates of colonisation, speciation and extinction differ
between different types of species (e.g. species that can fly vs those
that cannot)? Examples: bats and non-flying mammals of Madagascar (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35215-3" class="external-link">Michielsen et al
2023</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Is a focal island assemblage at equilibrium? Examples: Galápagos
birds (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12461" class="external-link">Valente et al
2015</a>), Caribbean bats (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0026" class="external-link">Valente et al 2017a</a>),
birds of Macaronesia (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.053" class="external-link">Valente et al
2017</a>). Is diversity on the island governed by ecological limits and
diversity dependence?</p></li>
<li><p>If diversity dependence is operating on the island, does it
operate at the level of the clade (within island lineages) or the island
(within and between island lineages)? Examples: Frogs of Caribbean (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syac074" class="external-link">Etienne et al 2023</a>),
Galápagos birds (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12461" class="external-link">Valente et
al 2015</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>How long would an island take to recover diversity back to a
pre-human diversity under natural rates of colonisation, speciation and
extinction? Examples: birds of New Zealand (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.06.058" class="external-link">Valente et al
2019</a>), bats of the West Indies (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0026" class="external-link">Valente et al
2017</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Do rates of colonisation, speciation and extinction vary through
time? Can we detect temporal shifts in rates? Examples: fishes of Lake
Biwa in Japan (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13914" class="external-link">Hauffe et al
2020</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>If currently threatened species go extinct from an island, how
long would it take to return to today’s diversity under natural rates of
colonisation, speciation and extinction? Examples: birds of New Zealand
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.06.058" class="external-link">Valente et al
2019</a>), mammals of Madagascar (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35215-3" class="external-link">Michielsen et al
2023</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>How do speciation, extinction and colonisation rates vary with
island area and isolation on a global scale? Example: birds of oceanic
islands archipelagos worldwide (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0026" class="external-link">Valente et al
2020</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>What do phylogenies of island taxa look like simulated under
different scenarios? Examples: continental, land-bridge and oceanic
islands (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14519" class="external-link">Neves et al
2022</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q5 - I have a time-calibrated phylogeny</strong> <strong>–
can I fit DAISIE to it?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but not immediately. Unlike most other phylogenetic methods,
DAISIE does not use as input a phylogenetic tree (see Q1). In the
context of DAISIE, phylogenies are simply used to extract times of
colonisation and speciation and to identify island lineages resulting
from different colonisation events. Therefore, you can use a single
phylogeny or many different phylogenies to obtain this information. But
you can even run DAISIE without any phylogeny at all, provided you have
estimates for island colonisation and speciation times of your focal
species (but these are usually obtained from phylogenetic
information).</p>
<p><strong>Q6 – What does an ideal DAISIE dataset look
like?</strong></p>
<p>The ‘ideal’ DAISIE dataset would be an island community dataset with
colonisation and speciation times extracted from a time-calibrated
phylogenetic tree (e.g. Figure 1) with complete sampling, in which all
species of the focal group are included (preferably multiple individuals
of the same species) as well as all of their closest non-island
relatives. In practice this type of dataset is rare. For most insular
communities, there may be a few well-sampled phylogenies available for
some of the insular lineages, while other lineages may have poorly
sampled phylogenies, and for some lineages there may be no dated
phylogenetic data available at all. For some non-endemic species there
may be individuals from the mainland sampled in the phylogeny, but not
from the island. DAISIE can incorporate information from these
heterogeneous data types.</p>

<p><em>Figure 1</em> – Visual representation of a typical dataset used
in DAISIE analyses. Modified from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.19.529129" class="external-link">Lambert et al 2023</a>.
In this hypothetical example, a focal island community on the Hawaiian
archipelago has nine species. Panel A shows the wider global phylogeny
in which the nine Hawaiian species are embedded (highlighted). Panel B
shows the separate phylogenies of those island species from the
perspective of the archipelago. Numbers on the plots link the
corresponding lineages from each panel. The island community (B)
consists of lineages resulting from four colonisation events, which are
spread out in different topological locations in the tree of the
taxonomic group at the global scale (A). Three of the island lineages
contain exclusively species that are endemic to the island and one
contains only a single non-endemic species. Two of the endemic lineages
have undergone cladogenetic speciation on the island, forming island
clades with more than one species. The colonisation time is assumed to
be the divergence time from the mainland sister species (stem age).</p>
<p><strong>Q7 – What should a focal island assemblage be in a DAISIE
analysis?</strong></p>
<p>The focal island assemblage (or focal community, or target group) can
be defined by the user, but it should make biogeographical and
ecological sense. It should be a group that can be defined by a common
source pool on the mainland. For example, if you work on plants, you may
choose to include all native species of plants, or focus just on a group
of interest, such as all ferns, all Asteraceae, all angiosperms. If you
work on birds, you may choose all bird species, but decide to exclude
migratory species as these do not follow classic colonisation “rules”.
What we do not recommend is cherry-picking lineages just because you
have phylogenies for them, and then excluding others for which you have
no phylogenetic data.</p>
<p><strong>Q8 - I have a large phylogeny (e.g. a plant family, or a bird
order) that includes many island species, can I run DAISIE?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but please note that DAISIE is meant to be applied to a specific
island or archipelago. Just because your clade of interest has many
island species, it does not mean DAISIE will be a good match for it. For
example, if your group has 20 island species and each is found on a
different island, then it may be difficult to have a suitable dataset to
run DAISIE, because ideally you would need an island with multiple
colonisation events by your focal group. (Note: you could run such an
analysis if you assume that (most of) the rates of colonisation,
extinction and speciation are similar across islands. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.053" class="external-link">this study on
Macaronesian birds</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Q9 - I have a phylogeny of an island radiation, can I apply
DAISIE?</strong></p>
<p>An island radiation results from a single colonisation event of the
island so there is a single lineage. DAISIE is designed to estimate
colonisation, speciation and extinction rates for an island assemblage
composed of multiple independent colonist lineages, not for a single
island lineage. Therefore, we do not recommend applying DAISIE if your
focal group is a single radiation. If you are interested in a single
island lineage, there are more appropriate lineage-specific phylogenetic
methods than DAISIE, such as the diversity-dependent birth-death model
implemented in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.DDD" class="external-link">DDD R package</a>
(Etienne).</p>
<p><strong>Q10 - I have compiled phylogenies for several plant (or
animal) lineages from an island. Can I apply DAISIE?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but you should not apply DAISIE to just a few groups and ignore
the other groups of your focal taxon that are present on the island. If
there are plant (or animal) lineages on the island that belong to your
focal group but for which phylogenetic data is not available, you need
to “inform” DAISIE about those missing lineages. DAISIE needs to know
how many lineages are missing from your focal group, and how many
species belong to each of those missing lineages.</p>
<p><strong>Q11 – Do I need to include non-endemic species, for example
widespread species found in multiple islands and
continents?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! DAISIE is meant to be applied to native island assemblages.
Therefore, both endemic and native non-endemic species are important! Do
not include just the island endemics in your analyses, because you would
be missing information on the natural colonisation events that gave rise
to the non-endemics. You might therefore underestimate colonisation
rates and overestimate anagenesis rates.</p>
<p><strong>Q12 – Should I include non-native species (introduced by
humans)?</strong></p>
<p>No. Species introduced by humans should normally not be included in
DAISIE analyses because they did not colonise under natural processes of
colonisation. *But note - if you wanted to consider only species
introduced by humans this could be possible, but this would constitute
an unusual type of analysis, because the rate of colonisation is
dependent on humans, not on the biogeography of the island.</p>
<p><strong>Q13 – Can I apply DAISIE to a subset of island lineages for
which I have phylogenies?</strong></p>
<p>DAISIE is designed to estimate rates for a complete island assemblage
(e.g. all amphibians on an island, all ferns on an archipelago).
Therefore, it is not meant to be applied to just a subset of those
lineages. So, for example, if you have an island that has 100
colonisation events of your focal taxon (some have radiated, others have
not), it is not appropriate to just pick 40 for which phylogenetic data
is available and exclude the other 60 colonists and their descendants.
If you only have phylogenetic data for a subset of the island lineages
of your focal taxon, you can still run DAISIE, but you need to include
all the lineages for which no phylogenetic data is available as missing
lineages.</p>
<p><strong>Q14 – How much missing data is acceptable?</strong></p>
<p>This is a good question that we do not yet have the answer to. Of
course, the more complete the data, the better. So having colonisation
and speciation times for the majority of your island species and
lineages is preferred. But if you don’t have colonisation or speciation
times for many of the lineages, you can still include them in the
analyses by “informing” DAISIE that you know that they are present on
the island but you just don’t know their colonisation or speciation
times. This information is useful for DAISIE. We wouldn’t recommend
doing this for all lineages and species because then DAISIE only knows
that the species are there, but doesn’t have any temporal information to
make inferences on. So in sum: the more phylogenetic data (colonisation
and branching times) the better, but having many missing species or
missing lineages is also fine!</p>
<p><strong>Q15 - How to handle island species that are not monophyletic
on the phylogeny?</strong></p>
<p>For example, what to do when two island individuals of (presumably)
the same species are retrieved in different positions in a phylogeny? In
these cases the user should make a decision based on their knowledge of
the taxa and system. If the user thinks that the non-monophyly may
indicate that the taxon should be split into different species, then
they may consider increasing the number of species in the island
lineage, and, if appropriate, increasing the number of island
colonisations (e.g. there may be cases where the same species colonised
the island multiple times). If the user thinks the non-monophyly is due
to incomplete lineage sorting or due to a mis-identification, then the
user may consider revising the phylogeny, or choosing a node to infer
the lineage age that reflects uncertainty (e.g. picking an older node
and using this as maximum time of colonisation).</p>
<p><strong>Q16 – How to define the number of species in the mainland
pool?</strong></p>
<p>The number of species in the mainland pool should be the number of
species on the mainland that belong to your focal group that could have
colonised the island since the island became available for colonisation.
The mainland itself can be defined by the user depending on the location
and isolation of the system (e.g. a nearby larger island, a continent).
From our experience, varying the mainland pool affects the colonisation
rate estimated in DAISIE, but does not alter other parameters or affect
model selection (in general). If you are unsure about which mainland
pool size to use, you may consider running sensitivity analyses using
different mainland pool sizes, to see how that affects the results.</p>
<p><strong>Q17 – How to obtain data on island age?</strong></p>
<p>Island age estimates can be obtained from the biogeographical or
geological literature (e.g. see the Methods section of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-016-0026" class="external-link">Valente et al 2020</a>
for the sources of the island ages used there).</p>
<p><strong>Q18 – Can I use DAISIE without DAISIEprep?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can prepare your DAISIE dataset “by eye” without using
DAISIEprep. But DAISIEprep will be very useful if you have large
datasets and it also greatly helps with reproducibility (and avoids
trying to find clades in a phylogeny by eye, instead doing it
automatically).</p>
