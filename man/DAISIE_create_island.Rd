\usage{
DAISIE_create_island(
  stt_table,
  total_time,
  island_spec,
  mainland_n,
  trait_pars = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stt_table}{Matrix with number of species at each time step.}

\item{total_time}{Numeric defining the length of the simulation in time
units.}

\item{island_spec}{Matrix with current state of simulation containing number
of species.}

\item{mainland_n}{A numeric stating the number of mainland species, that
is the number of species that can potentially colonize the island.
If using a clade-specific diversity dependence, this value is set to 1.
If using an island-wide diversity dependence, this value is set to the
number of mainland species.}

\item{trait_pars}{A named list containing diversification rates considering
  two trait states created by \code{\link{create_trait_pars}}:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]:A numeric with the per capita transition rate with state 1}
  \item{[2]:A numeric with the per capita immigration rate with state 2}
  \item{[3]:A numeric with the per capita extinction rate with state 2}
  \item{[4]:A numeric with the per capita anagenesis rate with state 2}
  \item{[5]:A numeric with the per capita cladogenesis rate with state 2}
  \item{[6]:A numeric with the per capita transition rate with state 2}
  \item{[7]:A numeric with the number of species with trait state 2 on
   mainland}

\value{
list with the island information, composed stt table,
branching times of extant species, status of species on
the island and number of missing species.
