\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric defining the length of the simulation in time units.
For example, if an island is known to be 4 million years old, setting
time = 4 will simulate the entire life span of the island; setting time = 2
will stop the simulation at the mid-life of the island.}

\item{M}{Numeric defining the size of mainland pool, i.e. the number of
species that can potentially colonize the island.}

\item{pars}{A numeric vector containing the model parameters:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{pars[1]}: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate)}
  \item{\code{pars[2]}: mu (extinction rate)}
  \item{\code{pars[3]}: K (carrying capacity), set K=Inf for diversity
  independence.}
  \item{\code{pars[4]}: gamma (immigration rate)}
  \item{\code{pars[5]}: lambda^a (anagenesis rate)}
  \item{\code{pars[6]}: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate) for either type 2 species
  or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{\code{pars[7]}: mu (extinction rate) for either type 2 species or rate
  set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{\code{pars[8]}: K (carrying capacity) for either type 2 species or rate
  set 2 in rate shift model, set K=Inf for diversity independence.}
  \item{\code{pars[9]}: gamma (immigration rate) for either type 2 species
  or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
  \item{\code{pars[10]}: lambda^a (anagenesis rate) for either type 2
  species or rate set 2 in rate shift model}
}
Elements 6:10 are required only when type 2 species are included
or in the rate shift model. For \code{\link{DAISIE_sim_relaxed_rate}()}
\code{pars[6]} is the standard deviation of the gamma distribution for the
relaxed parameter and the parameter chosen by the \code{relaxed_par}
argument is the mean of the gamma distribution for the relaxed parameter.}

\item{replicates}{Integer specifying number of island replicates to be
simulated.}

\item{divdepmodel}{Option divdepmodel = 'CS' runs a model with clade-specific
carrying capacity, where diversity-dependence operates only within single
clades, i.e. only among species originating from the same mainland
colonist. Option divdepmodel = 'IW' runs a model with island-wide
carrying capacity, where diversity-dependence operates within and among
clades. Option divdepmodel = 'GW' runs a model with diversity-dependence
operates within a guild.}

\item{nonoceanic_pars}{A vector of length two with:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]: the probability of sampling a species from the mainland}
  \item{[2]: the probability of the species sampled from the mainland

mainland species is divided by the number of guilds when
\code{divdepmodel = "GW"}}

\item{prop_type2_pool}{Fraction of mainland species that belongs to the
second subset of species (type 2). Applies only when two types of species
are simulated (length(pars) = 10). For \code{\link{DAISIE_dataprep}()}
applies only if number_clade_types = 2.  In \code{\link{DAISIE_dataprep}()}
the default \code{"proportional"} sets the fraction to be proportional to
the number of clades of distinct macroevolutionary process that have
colonised the island.}

\item{replicates_apply_type2}{Applies only when two types of species are
being simulated. Default replicates_apply_type2 = TRUE runs simulations
until the number of islands where a type 2 species has colonised is equal
to the specified number of replicates. This is recommended if
\code{prop_type2_pool} is small or if the rate of immigration of type two
species (\code{pars[9]}) is low, meaning that more replicates are needed to
achieved an adequate sample size of islands with type 2 species. Setting
\code{replicates_apply_type2 = FALSE} simulates islands up to the
specified number of replicates regardless of whether type 2 species have
colonised or not.}

\item{sample_freq}{Numeric specifing the number of units times should be
divided by for plotting purposes. Larger values will lead to plots with
higher resolution, but will also run slower.}

\item{plot_sims}{\code{Default = TRUE} plots species-through-time (STT)
plots. It detects how many types of species are present. If only one type
of species is present, STT is plotted for all species. If two types are
present, three plots are produced: STT for all, STT for type 1 and STT for
type 2.}

\item{verbose}{A numeric vector of length 1, which in simulations and
`DAISIEdataprep()` can be `1` or `0`, where `1` gives intermediate output
should be printed.
For ML functions a numeric determining if intermediate output should be
printed. The default: `0` does not print, `1` prints the initial
likelihood and the settings that were selected (which parameters are
to be optimised, fixed or shifted), `2` prints the same as `1 and also the
intermediate output of the parameters and loglikelihood, while `3` the
same as `2` and prints intermediate progress during likelihood computation.}

created by \code{\link{create_area_pars}()}:

  peak area is achieved}
  \item{[4]: total island age}

numeric describing the type of island ontogeny. Can be \code{0} for
constant, \code{1} for a beta function describing area through time. In ML
functions \code{island_ontogeny = NA} assumes constant ontogeny. Time
dependent estimation is not yet available as development is still ongoing.
Will return an error if called in that case.}

\item{sea_level}{In \code{\link{DAISIE_sim_time_dep}()} and plotting a
string describing the type of sea level. Can be \code{"const"} or
\code{"sine"} for a sine function describing area through time.

be \code{0} for constant, \code{1} for a sine function describing area
through time.}

\item{extcutoff}{A numeric with the cutoff for the the maximum extinction
rate preventing it from being too large and slowing down simulation.}

\item{shift_times}{a numeric vector specifying when the rate shifts occur
before the present.}

\item{mainland_n}{A numeric stating the number of mainland species, that
is the number of species that can potentially colonize the island.
If using a clade-specific diversity dependence, this value is set to 1.
If using an island-wide diversity dependence, this value is set to the
number of mainland species.}

Non-endemic, Non-endemic_MaxAge species and Endemic species with no close relatives

have the same values for both groups.}

\item{idparsmat}{For datatype = 'multiple' only: Matrix containing the ids
of the parameters, linking them to initparsopt and parsfix. Per island
system we use the following order: \cr \cr * lac = (initial) cladogenesis

individuals of the species have not been sampled and only the age of the
species is available) \cr * "Endemic": applies to endemic species and is
applicable for both cladogenetic and anagenetic species \cr *
"Endemic_MaxAge": applies to endemic species for cases where island
individuals of the species have not been sampled and only the age of the

\code{number_clade_types = 1}, then list_type2_clades = NA should be
specified (default).}

\item{epss}{Default= 1E-5 should be appropriate in most cases. This value
is used to set the maximum age of colonisation of "Non_endemic_MaxAge" and
"Endemic_MaxAge" species to an age that is slightly younger than the island

The new maximum age is then used as an upper bound to integrate over all.}

\item{proptime_max}{A numeric from 0 to 1. The same as
\code{proportional_peak_t}. Indicates, in proportion to the total island
age when the ontogeny peak should occur (i.e. 0.5 means a peak halfway in
time).}

\item{current_area}{A numeric with the current island area at present (i.e.,
at the end of the simulation).}

\item{jitter}{Numeric for \code{\link[DDD]{optimizer}()}. Jitters the
parameters being optimized by the specified amount which should be very
small, e.g. 1e-5. Jitter when \code{link{subplex}{subplex}()} produces
incorrect output due to parameter transformation.}

\item{num_cycles}{The number of cycles the optimizer will go through.
Default is 1.}

\item{trait_pars}{A named list containing diversification rates considering
  two trait states created by \code{\link{create_trait_pars}}:
\itemize{
  \item{[1]:A numeric with the per capita transition rate with state1}
  \item{[2]:A numeric with the per capita immigration rate with state2}
  \item{[3]:A numeric with the per capita extinction rate with state2}
  \item{[4]:A numeric with the per capita anagenesis rate with state2}
  \item{[5]:A numeric with the per capita cladogenesis rate with state2}
  \item{[6]:A numeric with the per capita transition rate with state2}
  \item{[7]:A numeric with the number of species with trait state 2 on
   mainland}
}}

\item{relaxed_par}{A string determining which parameter is relaxed in a
relaxed rate model.}

\item{relaxed_rate_pars}{A two element list the first element is the mean
of the gamma distribution, the second element is the standard deviation of
the gamma distribution. List can be created with
\code{create_relaxed_rate_pars()}}

\item{brts}{Numeric vector of branching times}

\item{stac}{Numeric of Endemicity status}

\item{missnumspec}{Numeric of missing species}

\item{DAISIE_par}{A numeric parameter to evaluate the integral of the
function.}

\item{DAISIE_dist_pars}{A numeric vector of two elements, first is the mean
and second the standard deviation of the distribution.}

\item{abstolint}{Numeric absolute tolerance of the integration}

\item{reltolint}{Numeric relative tolerance of the integration}

\item{pick}{Numeric determining which parameter is selected for the
relaxed-rate model}

\item{mean}{Numeric mean of the distribution}

\item{sd}{Numeric standard deviation of the distribution}

\item{clado_rate}{Numeric rate of cladogenesis}

\item{ext_rate}{Numeric rate of extinction}

\item{carr_cap}{Numeric carrying capacity}

\item{immig_rate}{Numeric rate of immigration}

\item{ana_rate}{Numeric rate of anagenesis}

\item{islands}{Island datalist or simulated data in DAISIE datalist format.
Can be a single island (empirical data) generated with DAISIE_dataprep or
DAISIEprep. Can also be simulated data generated with DAISIE_sim function.}

\item{sort_clade_sizes}{Default sort_clade_sizes=T outputs clade sizes
sorted in ascending order of number of species. sort_clade_sizes=F outputs
clade sizes in the same order as they appear in the input datalist.}
