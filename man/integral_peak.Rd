\title{Computes integral of a very peaked function, modified from the SADISA package}
\usage{
integral_peak(
  logfun,
  xx = seq(-100, 20, 2),
  xcutoff = 2,
  ymaxthreshold = 1e-12,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{logfun}{the logarithm of the function to integrate}

\item{xx}{the initial set of points on which to evaluate the function}

\item{xcutoff}{when the maximum has been found among the xx, this parameter sets the width of the interval to find the maximum in}

\item{ymaxthreshold}{sets the deviation allowed in finding the maximum among the xx}

\item{...}{any arguments of the function to optimize}

\item{ycutoff}{set the threshold below which (on a log scale) the function is deemed negligible, i.e. that it does not contribute to the integral)}
}
\value{
the result of the integration
