# Simulates island replicates with an island-wide (IW) diversity-dependent constant-rate process

Simulates island replicates with an island-wide (IW) diversity-dependent
constant-rate process

## Usage

``` r
DAISIE_sim_cr_iw(
  total_time,
  M,
  pars,
  replicates,
  nonoceanic_pars,
  sample_freq,
  hyper_pars,
  area_pars,
  cond,
  verbose,
  use_rcpp = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- total_time:

  Numeric defining the length of the simulation in time units.

- M:

  Numeric defining the size of mainland pool, i.e. the number of species
  that can potentially colonize the island.

- pars:

  A numeric vector containing the model parameters:

  - `pars[1]`: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate)

  - `pars[2]`: mu (extinction rate)

  - `pars[3]`: K (carrying capacity), set K=Inf for diversity
    independence.

  - `pars[4]`: gamma (immigration rate)

  - `pars[5]`: lambda^a (anagenesis rate)

  - `pars[6]`: lambda^c (cladogenesis rate) for either type 2 species or
    rate set 2 in rate shift model

  - `pars[7]`: mu (extinction rate) for either type 2 species or rate
    set 2 in rate shift model

  - `pars[8]`: K (carrying capacity) for either type 2 species or rate
    set 2 in rate shift model, set K=Inf for diversity independence.

  - `pars[9]`: gamma (immigration rate) for either type 2 species or
    rate set 2 in rate shift model

  - `pars[10]`: lambda^a (anagenesis rate) for either type 2 species or
    rate set 2 in rate shift model

  Elements 6:10 are required only when type 2 species are included or in
  the rate shift model. For
  [`DAISIE_sim_relaxed_rate()`](https://rsetienne.github.io/DAISIE/reference/DAISIE_sim_relaxed_rate.md)
  `pars[6]` is the standard deviation of the gamma distribution for the
  relaxed parameter and the parameter chosen by the `relaxed_par`
  argument is the mean of the gamma distribution for the relaxed
  parameter.

- replicates:

  Integer specifying number of island replicates to be simulated.

- nonoceanic_pars:

  A vector of length two with:

  - \[1\]: the probability of sampling a species from the mainland

  - \[2\]: the probability of the species sampled from the mainland
    being nonendemic

- sample_freq:

  Numeric specifing the number of units times should be divided by for
  plotting purposes. Larger values will lead to plots with higher
  resolution, but will also run slower.

- hyper_pars:

  A named list of numeric hyperparameters for the rate calculations as
  returned by
  [`create_hyper_pars()`](https://rsetienne.github.io/DAISIE/reference/create_hyper_pars.md):

  - \[1\]: is d the scaling parameter for exponent for calculating
    cladogenesis rate

  - \[2\]: is x the exponent for calculating extinction rate

- area_pars:

  A named list containing area and sea level parameters as created by
  [`create_area_pars()`](https://rsetienne.github.io/DAISIE/reference/create_area_pars.md):

  - \[1\]: maximum area

  - \[2\]: current area

  - \[3\]: value from 0 to 1 indicating where in the island's history
    the peak area is achieved

  - \[4\]: total island age

  - \[5\]: amplitude of area fluctuation from sea level

  - \[6\]: frequency of sine wave of area change from sea level

  - \[7\]: angle of the slope of the island

- cond:

  cond = 0 : conditioning on island age  
  cond = 1 : conditioning on island age and non-extinction of the island
  biota  
  . cond \> 1 : conditioning on island age and having at least cond
  colonizations on the island. This last option is not yet available for
  the IW model  

- verbose:

  A numeric vector of length 1, which in simulations and
  \`DAISIEdataprep()\` can be \`1\` or \`0\`, where \`1\` gives
  intermediate output should be printed. For ML functions a numeric
  determining if intermediate output should be printed. The default:
  \`0\` does not print, \`1\` prints the initial likelihood and the
  settings that were selected (which parameters are to be optimised,
  fixed or shifted), \`2\` prints the same as \`1 and also the
  intermediate output of the parameters and loglikelihood, while \`3\`
  the same as \`2\` and prints intermediate progress during likelihood
  computation.

- use_rcpp:

  If TRUE, use Rcpp implementation of DAISIE simulation core. Default is
  FALSE.

## Value

A list. The highest level of the least corresponds to each individual
replicate. See return for \`DAISIE_sim_cr()\` for details.
